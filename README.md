## 🎯 Chosen Vertical

**Physical Event Experience** — Designing a solution that improves the physical event experience for attendees at large-scale sporting venues by addressing crowd movement, waiting times, and real-time coordination.

---

## 🧠 Approach & Logic

### Problem Analysis

Large-scale sporting venues (60,000–80,000+ capacity) present significant challenges:

1. **Crowd Congestion** — Attendees struggle to navigate through congested areas, wasting time and energy
2. **Long Wait Times** — Food, restroom, and exit queues can exceed 20+ minutes during peak periods
3. **Information Gap** — No real-time visibility into crowd conditions, queue lengths, or venue status
4. **Emergency Coordination** — In critical situations, communication and evacuation guidance are inadequate
5. **Disconnected Experience** — Attendees lack a unified tool for navigation, ordering, and event updates

### Solution: Context-Aware Intelligence

VenueFlow solves these problems through **real-time data fusion and AI-powered decision-making**:

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Mobile-first PWA** — Attendees use phones at venues; installable, offline-capable
- **No build step** — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity, speed, and repo size compliance (<1MB)
- **Simulated data fallback** — Works without API keys by generating realistic venue data
- **Context-aware AI** — Gemini receives live venue state (crowd, queues, seat location) for intelligent responses
- **Accessibility-first** — ARIA, keyboard nav, text-to-speech, high contrast, large text modes

### Design Patterns

- **Reactive State Store** — Centralized state with subscriber pattern (`AppState.subscribe()`)
- **View Lifecycle** — Each view has `render()` and `destroy()` methods managed by the router
- **Service Layer** — Google API integrations abstracted into service modules
- **Progressive Enhancement** — All Google services have graceful fallbacks
- **Mobile-First Responsive** — Designed for 320-480px viewports with desktop support

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- A local HTTP server (for service worker support)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/venueflow.git
cd venueflow

# Option 1: Python HTTP server
python -m http.server 8080

# Option 2: Node.js http-server
npx http-server -p 8080

# Option 3: VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Optional Live Service Keys

The repo now defaults to safe local fallbacks for Maps, Gemini, and Firebase. To enable live services, define runtime config before the app scripts load:

```html
<script>
  window.__VENUEFLOW_RUNTIME__ = {
    maps: { apiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' },
    gemini: { apiKey: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY' },
    firebase: {
      apiKey: 'YOUR_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY',
      authDomain: 'your-project.firebaseapp.com',
      databaseURL: 'https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com',
      projectId: 'your-project',
      storageBucket: 'your-project.firebasestorage.app',
      messagingSenderId: '1234567890',
      appId: '1:1234567890:web:abcdef'
    }
  };
</script>
```

### Running Tests

Open `http://localhost:8080/tests/index.html` in your browser to run the test suite.

## 📐 Assumptions

1. **Venue Context** — The app is pre-configured for Narendra Modi Stadium (IPL match day) as a demonstration. In production, this would be dynamically configured per venue
2. **Real-Time Data** — Queue and crowd data are simulated with realistic patterns. In production, this would integrate with venue IoT sensors and camera systems
3. **API Keys** — Live Google and Firebase keys are injected at runtime through `window.__VENUEFLOW_RUNTIME__`; without them the app stays in fallback or simulated mode
4. **Single User** — The app demonstrates the attendee experience from a single user's perspective (Section 134, Row H, Seat 12)
5. **Offline Capability** — The service worker caches static assets; real-time features require network connectivity
6. **Mobile Primary** — Designed primarily for mobile use at venues (480px max-width container)

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **XSS Prevention** — All user input in the chat is HTML-escaped before rendering
- **Content Security** — External scripts loaded only from trusted Google CDNs
- **Safe Navigation** — `window.open()` calls use `noopener,noreferrer`
- **SOS Confirmation** — Emergency alerts require user confirmation before dispatch
- **No Data Storage** — No sensitive user data stored in localStorage; session-only state
- **Service Worker** — Scoped caching with network-first strategy for data freshness

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- **ARIA Landmarks** — Proper `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-live` attributes throughout
- **Keyboard Navigation** — Full keyboard support with number keys (1-6) for quick nav
- **Screen Reader** — Live region announcements for all state changes
- **Text-to-Speech** — Web Speech API integration for audible alerts
- **High Contrast Mode** — Toggle for enhanced visual contrast
- **Large Text Mode** — Scalable typography for visibility
- **Focus Management** — Visible focus indicators, focus trapping in modals
- **Reduced Motion** — Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Semantic HTML** — Proper heading hierarchy, landmark elements

---
